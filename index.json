We propose APGAI, an anytime and parameter-free sampling rule for GAI in stochastic bandits. APGAI can be straightforwardly used in fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings. First, we derive upper bounds on its probability of error at any time. They show that adaptive strategies are more efficient in detecting the absence of good arms than uniform sampling. Second, when APGAI is combined with a stopping rule, we prove upper bounds on the expected sampling complexity, holding at any confidence level. Finally, we show good empirical performance of APGAI on synthetic and real-world data.

In this talk, I will present recent advances on the theoretical understanding of Top Two algorithms, and sketch remaining open problems. Our first contribution is a general analysis of Top Two methods in the asymptotic regime, which identifies desirable properties of the leader, the challenger, and the (possibly non-parametric) distributions of the arms. As a result, we obtain theoretically supported Top Two algorithms for best arm identification with bounded distributions. Our second contribution is to derive the first non-asymptotic upper bound on the expected sample complexity of a Top Two algorithm, which holds for any error level and any instance having a unique best arm. In particular, we identify sufficient properties of the leader (seen as a regret minimization algorithm) for it to hold. As a consequence, we propose the TTUCB (Top Two UCB) algorithm which builds on the UCB algorithm and uses tracking instead of sampling to choose between the leader and the challenger.","tags":[],"title":"LAS Seminar: Best-Arm Identification with Top Two Algorithms","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Rémy Degenne","Emilie Kaufmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1674432e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685090503,"objectID":"b77fa58e05a7f679e39f2cbb7f76855d","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/baiuv/","publishdate":"2023-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/baiuv/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem of identifying the best arm among a collection of items having Gaussian rewards distribution is well understood when the variances are known.

In order to calibrate our two stopping rules, we derive new time-uniform concentration inequalities, which are of independent interest. Then, we illustrate the theoretical and empirical performances of our two sampling rule wrappers on Track-and-Stop and on a Top Two algorithm. Moreover, by quantifying the impact on the sample complexity of not knowing the variances, we reveal that it is rather small.","tags":["Multi-armed bandits","Best-arm identification","Gaussian Bandits","Unknown Variances","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Dealing with Unknown Variances in Best-Arm Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662056400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661423087,"objectID":"2f232cb7ed9e9fd0ce4446a8929c92d2","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/talk/statmathappli/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/statmathappli/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"StatMathAppli: Top Two Algorithms Revisited","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655463600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661423087,"objectID":"135684e84f1a12f3540bc2dc78009356","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/talk/scoolseminarnpbai/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/scoolseminarnpbai/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Scool Seminar: Top Two Algorithms Revisited","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Rémy Degenne","Dorian Baudry","Rianne de Heide","Emilie Kaufmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695394428,"objectID":"5bbdfc4a66db2f3a740f133ea40e4107","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/npbai/","publishdate":"2022-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/npbai/","section":"publication","summary":"Top Two algorithms arose as an adaptation of Thompson sampling to best arm identification in multi-armed bandit models (Russo, 2016), for parametric families of arms. They select the next arm to sample from by randomizing among two candidate arms, a leader and a challenger. Despite their good empirical performance, theoretical guarantees for fixed-confidence best arm identification have only been obtained when the arms are Gaussian with known variances. In this paper, we provide a general analysis of Top Two methods, which identifies desirable properties of the leader, the challenger, and the (possibly non-parametric) distributions of the arms. As a result, we obtain theoretically supported Top Two algorithms for best arm identification with bounded distributions. Our proof method demonstrates in particular that the sampling step used to select the leader inherited from Thompson sampling can be replaced by other choices, like selecting the empirical best arm.","tags":["Multi-armed bandits","Best-arm identification","Bounded distribution","Top Two algorithm","Thompson sampling","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Top Two Algorithms Revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Rémy Degenne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654732800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664995596,"objectID":"fee44981ab20e5727e18d793f6021b9a","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/lebai/","publishdate":"2022-06-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lebai/","section":"publication","summary":"In pure-exploration problems, information is gathered sequentially to answer a question on the stochastic environment. While best-arm identification for linear bandits has been extensively studied in recent years, few works have been dedicated to identifying one arm that is ε-close to the best one (and not exactly the best one). In this problem with several correct answers, an identification algorithm should focus on one candidate among those answers and verify that it is correct. We demonstrate that picking the answer with highest mean does not allow an algorithm to reach asymptotic optimality in terms of expected sample complexity. Instead, a *furthest answer* should be identified. Using that insight to choose the candidate answer carefully, we develop a simple procedure to adapt best-arm identification algorithms to tackle ε-best-answer identification in transductive linear stochastic bandits. Finally, we propose an asymptotically optimal algorithm for this setting, which is shown to achieve competitive empirical performance against existing modified best-arm identification algorithms.","tags":["Linear bandits","Transductive bandits","Epsilon best-answer identification","Gaussian","Game algorithm","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Choosing Answers in ε-Best-Answer Identification for Linear Bandits","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640596262,"objectID":"64518e4b0412473dafe58c30a2820011","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/teaching/univlille_sc_ss22/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/univlille_sc_ss22/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor: Céline Duval and Amir Aboubacar","tags":[],"title":"Statistique computationnelle","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Karolis Martinkus","David Roschewitz","Martin Strohmeier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664999454,"objectID":"2828612c308f2bdec2378ab6acea3059","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/pfdcsa/","publishdate":"2021-12-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfdcsa/","section":"publication","summary":"As data of aircraft movements have become freely accessible on a large scale through means of crowdsourcing, their open source intelligence (OSINT) value has been illustrated in many different domains. Potentially sensitive movements of all stakeholders outside commercial aviation are potentially affected, from corporate jets to military and government aircraft. Until now, this OSINT value was shown only on historical data, where automated analysis on flight destinations has been effective to find information on potential mergers \u0026 acquisition deals or diplomatic relationships between governments. In practice, obtaining such information as early as possible is crucial. Hence, in this work, we predict the destinations of state and corporate aircraft on live data, while the targets are still in the air. We use machine learning algorithms to predict the area of landing up to 2 h in advance. We evaluate our approach on more than 500,000 flights during 2018 obtained from the OpenSky Network.","tags":["Crowdsourcing","Aircraft tracking","Open source intelligence"],"title":"I Know Where You Are Going: Predicting Flight Destinations of Corporate and State Aircraft","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637319600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661423087,"objectID":"977bee9cbc7f275a6cee096dae786b85","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/talk/scoolseminarlebai/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/scoolseminarlebai/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Scool Seminar: Choosing Answers in ε-Best-Answer Identification for Linear Bandits","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Mojmír Mutný","Johannes Kirschner","Andreas Krause"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664998333,"objectID":"0c5cd8fdf937ffe539047eb4cb9129d3","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/pecb/","publishdate":"2021-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pecb/","section":"publication","summary":"Combinatorial bandits with semi-bandit feedback generalize multi-armed bandits, where the agent chooses sets of arms and observes a noisy reward for each arm contained in the chosen set. The action set satisfies a given structure such as forming a base of a matroid or a path in a graph. We focus on the pure-exploration problem of identifying the best arm with fixed confidence, as well as a more general setting, where the structure of the answer set differs from the one of the action set. Using the recently popularized game framework, we interpret this problem as a sequential zero-sum game and develop a CombGame meta-algorithm whose instances are asymptotically optimal algorithms with finite time guarantees. In addition to comparing two families of learners to instantiate our meta-algorithm, the main contribution of our work is a specific oracle efficient instance for best-arm identification with combinatorial actions. Based on a projection-free online learning algorithm for convex polytopes, it is the first computationally efficient algorithm which is asymptotically optimal and has competitive empirical performance.","tags":["Combinatorial bandits","Transductive bandits","Best-arm identification","Semi-bandit feedback","Game algorithm","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Efficient Pure Exploration for Combinatorial Bandits with Semi-Bandit Feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602673200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661423087,"objectID":"136310ce33f57867e7b79ab7a5eae28e","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/talk/lasseminar/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/lasseminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"LAS Seminar: Efficient Pure Exploration for Combinatorial Bandits with Semi-Bandit Feedback","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626630247,"objectID":"bd87c4f0cbe5e9f5d541f1e81b3face2","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/teaching/eth_mp_ss20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/eth_mp_ss20/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor: Otmar Hilliges","tags":[],"title":"Machine Perception","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Sebastien Blandin","Laura Wynter","Pralhad Deshpande"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541548800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664999454,"objectID":"29e2b66a4c5cc6ac7148279be042e956","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/pm_btc/","publishdate":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pm_btc/","section":"publication","summary":"The Bitcoin transaction graph is a public data structure organized as transactions between addresses, each associated with a logical entity.

We then extend the model to include hidden entity attributes such as the functional category of the associated logical agent and derive asymptotic bounds on the privacy properties implied by this model. At the network level, we show evidence of complex transaction-to-transaction behavior and present a relevant discriminative model of the agent categories.

This premise of a free decentralized transactional network however requires, in its current implementation, unrestricted access to the ledger for peer-based transaction verification. A number of studies have shown that, in this pseudonymous context, identities can be leaked based on transaction features or off-network information. In this work, we analyze the information revealed by the pattern of transactions in the neighborhood of a given entity transaction. By definition, these features which pertain to an extended network are not directly controllable by the entity, but might enable leakage of information about transacting entities. We define a number of new features relevant to entity characterization on the Bitcoin Blockchain and study their efficacy in practice. We show that even a weak attacker with shallow data mining knowledge is able to leverage these features to characterize the entity properties.","tags":["Bitcoin","Privacy","Pattern classification","Bipartite graph"],"title":"Characterizing Entities in the Bitcoin Blockchain","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612908990,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
