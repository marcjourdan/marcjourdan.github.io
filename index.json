They select the next arm to sample from by randomizing among two candidate arms, a leader and a challenger. Despite their good empirical performance, theoretical guarantees for fixed-confidence best arm identification have only been obtained when the arms are Gaussian with known variances. In this paper, we provide a general analysis of Top Two methods, which identifies desirable properties of the leader, the challenger, and the (possibly non-parametric) distributions of the arms. As a result, we obtain theoretically supported Top Two algorithms for best arm identification with bounded distributions. Our proof method demonstrates in particular that the sampling step used to select the leader inherited from Thompson sampling can be replaced by other choices, like selecting the empirical best arm.","tags":["Multi-armed bandits","Best-arm identification","Bounded distribution","Top Two algorithm","Thompson sampling","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Top Two Algorithms Revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Rémy Degenne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654732800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661419042,"objectID":"fee44981ab20e5727e18d793f6021b9a","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/lebai/","publishdate":"2022-06-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lebai/","section":"publication","summary":"In pure-exploration problems, information is gathered sequentially to answer a question on the stochastic environment. While best-arm identification for linear bandits has been extensively studied in recent years, few works have been dedicated to identifying one arm that is ε-close to the best one (and not exactly the best one). In this problem with several correct answers, an identification algorithm should focus on one candidate among those answers and verify that it is correct. We demonstrate that picking the answer with highest mean does not allow an algorithm to reach asymptotic optimality in terms of expected sample complexity. Instead, a *furthest answer* should be identified. Using that insight to choose the candidate answer carefully, we develop a simple procedure to adapt best-arm identification algorithms to tackle ε-best-answer identification in transductive linear stochastic bandits. Finally, we propose an asymptotically optimal algorithm for this setting, which is shown to achieve competitive empirical performance against existing modified best-arm identification algorithms.","tags":["Linear bandits","Transductive bandits","Epsilon best-answer identification","Gaussian","Game algorithm","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Choosing Answers in ε-Best-Answer Identification for Linear Bandits","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640596262,"objectID":"64518e4b0412473dafe58c30a2820011","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/teaching/univlille_sc_ss22/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/univlille_sc_ss22/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor: Céline Duval and Amir Aboubacar","tags":[],"title":"Statistique computationnelle","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Karolis Martinkus","David Roschewitz","Martin Strohmeier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640595463,"objectID":"2828612c308f2bdec2378ab6acea3059","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/pfdcsa/","publishdate":"2021-12-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfdcsa/","section":"publication","summary":"As data of aircraft movements have become freely accessible on a large scale through means of crowdsourcing, their open source intelligence (OSINT) value has been illustrated in many different domains. Potentially sensitive movements of all stakeholders outside commercial aviation are potentially affected, from corporate jets to military and government aircraft. Until now, this OSINT value was shown only on historical data, where automated analysis on flight destinations has been effective to find information on potential mergers \u0026 acquisition deals or diplomatic relationships between governments. In practice, obtaining such information as early as possible is crucial. Hence, in this work, we predict the destinations of state and corporate aircraft on live data, while the targets are still in the air. We use machine learning algorithms to predict the area of landing up to 2 h in advance. We evaluate our approach on more than 500,000 flights during 2018 obtained from the OpenSky Network.","tags":["Crowdsourcing","Aircraft tracking","Open source intelligence"],"title":"I Know Where You Are Going: Predicting Flight Destinations of Corporate and State Aircraft","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637319600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661423087,"objectID":"977bee9cbc7f275a6cee096dae786b85","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/talk/scoolseminarlebai/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/scoolseminarlebai/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Scool Seminar: Choosing Answers in ε-Best-Answer Identification for Linear Bandits","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Mojmír Mutný","Johannes Kirschner","Andreas Krause"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661419042,"objectID":"0c5cd8fdf937ffe539047eb4cb9129d3","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/pecb/","publishdate":"2021-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pecb/","section":"publication","summary":"Combinatorial bandits with semi-bandit feedback generalize multi-armed bandits, where the agent chooses sets of arms and observes a noisy reward for each arm contained in the chosen set. The action set satisfies a given structure such as forming a base of a matroid or a path in a graph. We focus on the pure-exploration problem of identifying the best arm with fixed confidence, as well as a more general setting, where the structure of the answer set differs from the one of the action set. Using the recently popularized game framework, we interpret this problem as a sequential zero-sum game and develop a CombGame meta-algorithm whose instances are asymptotically optimal algorithms with finite time guarantees. In addition to comparing two families of learners to instantiate our meta-algorithm, the main contribution of our work is a specific oracle efficient instance for best-arm identification with combinatorial actions. Based on a projection-free online learning algorithm for convex polytopes, it is the first computationally efficient algorithm which is asymptotically optimal and has competitive empirical performance.","tags":["Combinatorial bandits","Transductive bandits","Best-arm identification","Semi-bandit feedback","Game algorithm","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Efficient Pure Exploration for Combinatorial Bandits with Semi-Bandit Feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602673200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661423087,"objectID":"136310ce33f57867e7b79ab7a5eae28e","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/talk/lasseminar/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/lasseminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"LAS Seminar: Efficient Pure Exploration for Combinatorial Bandits with Semi-Bandit Feedback","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626630247,"objectID":"bd87c4f0cbe5e9f5d541f1e81b3face2","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/teaching/eth_mp_ss20/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/eth_mp_ss20/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor: Otmar Hilliges","tags":[],"title":"Machine Perception","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Sebastien Blandin","Laura Wynter","Pralhad Deshpande"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541548800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661419042,"objectID":"29e2b66a4c5cc6ac7148279be042e956","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/publication/pm_btc/","publishdate":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pm_btc/","section":"publication","summary":"The Bitcoin transaction graph is a public data structure organized as transactions between addresses, each associated with a logical entity. In this work, we introduce a complete probabilistic model of the Bitcoin Blockchain, setting the basis for follow-up AI applications on Bitcoin transactions.

We then extend the model to include hidden entity attributes such as the functional category of the associated logical agent and derive asymptotic bounds on the privacy properties implied by this model. At the network level, we show evidence of complex transaction-to-transaction behavior and present a relevant discriminative model of the agent categories.

This premise of a free decentralized transactional network however requires, in its current implementation, unrestricted access to the ledger for peer-based transaction verification. A number of studies have shown that, in this pseudonymous context, identities can be leaked based on transaction features or off-network information. In this work, we analyze the information revealed by the pattern of transactions in the neighborhood of a given entity transaction. By definition, these features which pertain to an extended network are not directly controllable by the entity, but might enable leakage of information about transacting entities. We define a number of new features relevant to entity characterization on the Bitcoin Blockchain and study their efficacy in practice. We show that even a weak attacker with shallow data mining knowledge is able to leverage these features to characterize the entity properties.","tags":["Bitcoin","Privacy","Pattern classification","Bipartite graph"],"title":"Characterizing Entities in the Bitcoin Blockchain","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612908990,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://thirsty-goodall-d21ccc.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
