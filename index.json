Few works have studied GAI in the fixed-budget setting, when the sampling budget is fixed beforehand, or the anytime setting, when a recommendation can be asked at any time. We propose APGAI, an anytime and parameter-free sampling rule for GAI in stochastic bandits. APGAI can be straightforwardly used in fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings. First, we derive upper bounds on its probability of error at any time. They show that adaptive strategies are more efficient in detecting the absence of good arms than uniform sampling. Second, when APGAI is combined with a stopping rule, we prove upper bounds on the expected sampling complexity, holding at any confidence level. Finally, we show good empirical performance of APGAI on synthetic and real-world data. Our work offers an extensive overview of the GAI problem in all settings.","tags":["Multi-armed bandits","Pure exploration","Good arm identification","Anytime"],"title":"An Anytime Algorithm for Good Arm Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Achraf Azize"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1758326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1765227421,"objectID":"0176c7509ed1582f22bcc040f83070c7","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/dptt/","publishdate":"2025-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dptt/","section":"publication","summary":"Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms are deployed in data-sensitive applications, such as adaptive clinical trials or user studies. Driven by the privacy concerns of these applications, we study the problem of fixed-confidence BAI under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli distributions. While numerous asymptotically optimal BAI algorithms exist in the non-private setting, a significant gap remains between the best lower and upper bounds in the global DP setting. This work reduces this gap to a small multiplicative constant, for any privacy budget ϵ. First, we provide a tighter lower bound on the expected sample complexity of any δ-correct and ϵ-global DP strategy. Our lower bound replaces the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence in the transportation cost used by the non-private characteristic time with a new information-theoretic quantity that optimally trades off between the KL divergence and the Total Variation distance scaled by ϵ. Second, we introduce a stopping rule based on these transportation costs and a private estimator of the means computed using an arm-dependent geometric batching. En route to proving the correctness of our stopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the Laplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions. Third, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs. For any budget ϵ, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected sample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant smaller than 8. Our algorithm outperforms existing δ-correct and ϵ-global DP BAI algorithms for different values of ϵ.","tags":["Differential privacy","Multi-armed bandits","Best-arm identification","Fixed confidence","Top Two algorithm"],"title":"Optimal Best Arm Identification under Differential Privacy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Gizem Yüce","Nicolas Flammarion"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1746057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1761561155,"objectID":"08ac8eaceccdeb56486b4a3d9141a617","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/ldps/","publishdate":"2025-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ldps/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences. Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of $O(1/n)$ --- a significant improvement over the $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n})$ rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants. While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for preferences based on the log-probability reward.","tags":["Statistical learning","Continuous parametric distributions","Preference feedback","Estimation error rate"],"title":"Learning Parametric Distributions from Samples and Preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyrille Kone","Marc Jourdan","Emilie Kaufmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1730937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748704243,"objectID":"fe16af4bb9a78526b088387ac3eb3de6","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/psips/","publishdate":"2024-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/psips/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem of identifying the best answer among a collection of items having real-valued distribution is well-understood. Despite its practical relevance for many applications, fewer works have studied its extension when multiple and potentially conflicting metrics are available to assess an item's quality. Pareto set identification (PSI) aims to identify the set of answers whose means are not uniformly worse than another. This paper studies PSI in the transductive linear setting with potentially correlated objectives. Building on posterior sampling in both the stopping and the sampling rules, we propose the PSIPS algorithm that deals simultaneously with structure and correlation without paying the computational cost of existing oracle-based algorithms. Both from a frequentist and Bayesian perspective, PSIPS is asymptotically optimal. We demonstrate its good empirical performance in real-world and synthetic instances.","tags":["Multi-armed bandits","Pure exploration","Pareto set identification","Posterior sampling"],"title":"Pareto Set Identification with Posterior Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riccardo Poiani","Marc Jourdan","Emilie Kaufmann","Rémy Degenne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1730678400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748704243,"objectID":"9e684eca154a2fab314772819c118263","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/ubai/","publishdate":"2024-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ubai/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the fixed-confidence best-arm identification problem in unimodal bandits, in which the means of the arms increase with the index of the arm up to their maximum, then decrease. We derive two lower bounds on the stopping time of any algorithm. The instance-dependent lower bound suggests that due to the unimodal structure, only three arms contribute to the leading confidence-dependent cost. However, a worst-case lower bound shows that a linear dependence on the number of arms is unavoidable in the confidence-independent cost. We propose modifications of Track-and-Stop and a Top Two algorithm that leverage the unimodal structure. Both versions of Track-and-Stop are asymptotically optimal for one-parameter exponential families. The Top Two algorithm is asymptotically near-optimal for Gaussian distributions and we prove a non-asymptotic guarantee matching the worse-case lower bound.

Motivated by the data privacy concerns invoked by these applications, we study the problem of BAI with fixed confidence in both the local and central models, i.e. ϵ-local and ϵ-global Differential Privacy (DP). First, to quantify the cost of privacy, we derive lower bounds on the sample complexity of any δ-correct BAI algorithm satisfying ϵ-global DP or ϵ-local DP. Our lower bounds suggest the existence of two privacy regimes. In the high-privacy regime, the hardness depends on a coupled effect of privacy and novel information-theoretic quantities involving the Total Variation. In the low-privacy regime, the lower bounds reduce to the non-private lower bounds. We propose ϵ-local DP and ϵ-global DP variants of a Top Two algorithm, namely CTB-TT and AdaP-TT*, respectively. For ϵ-local DP, CTB-TT is asymptotically optimal by plugging in a private estimator of the means based on Randomised Response. For ϵ-global DP, our private estimator of the mean runs in arm-dependent adaptive episodes and adds Laplace noise to ensure a good privacy-utility trade-off. By adapting the transportation costs, the expected sample complexity of AdaP-TT* reaches the asymptotic lower bound up to multiplicative constants.","tags":["Differential privacy","Multi-armed bandits","Best-arm identification","Fixed confidence","Top Two algorithm"],"title":"Differentially Private Best-Arm Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1708348500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718711851,"objectID":"b9976c6f92c5889eade3bf247453d59f","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/talk/flairseminar/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/flairseminar/","section":"talk","summary":"In pure exploration problems for stochastic multi-armed bandits, the goal is to answer a question about a set of unknown distributions (modeling for example the efficacy of a treatment) from which we can collect samples (measure its effect), and to provide guarantees on the candidate answer.

In the fixed-confidence setting, Top Two algorithms have an asymptotically optimal expected sample complexity (number of collected samples when the error level vanishes). In the anytime setting, we propose a Top Two algorithm which has guarantees on the probability of misidentifying a good enough arm at any time. Finally, Top Two algorithms can be easily adapted to become differentially private algorithms with near optimal guarantees on the expected sample complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Data Science Seminar: Solving pure exploration problems with the Top Two approach","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Rémy Degenne","Emilie Kaufmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1695254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710152084,"objectID":"23acf435b346bbb7e1aa7381c75af42a","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/ttebai/","publishdate":"2023-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ttebai/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose EB-TCε, a novel sampling rule for ε-best arm identification in stochastic bandits.

EB-TCε is an *anytime* sampling rule that can therefore be employed without modification for fixed confidence or fixed budget identification (without prior knowledge of the budget). We provide three types of theoretical guarantees for EB-TCε. First, we prove bounds on its expected sample complexity in the fixed confidence setting, notably showing its asymptotic optimality in combination with an adaptive tuning of its exploration parameter. We complement these findings with upper bounds on its probability of error at any time and for any error parameter, which further yield upper bounds on its simple regret at any time. Finally, we show through numerical simulations that EB-TCε performs favorably compared to existing algorithms, in different settings.","tags":["Multi-armed bandits","Pure exploration","Epsilon-best-arm identification","Top Two algorithm","Anytime"],"title":"An ε-Best-Arm Identification Algorithm for Fixed-Confidence and Beyond","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achraf Azize","Marc Jourdan","Aymen Al Marjani","Debabrota Basu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1695168e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701896400,"objectID":"c813a12c8b5eb2fdc1e544f0cd1b06f1","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/pbai/","publishdate":"2023-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pbai/","section":"publication","summary":"Best Arm Identification (BAI) problems are progressively used for data-sensitive applications, such as designing adaptive clinical trials, tuning hyper-parameters, and conducting user studies to name a few. Motivated by the data privacy concerns invoked by these applications, we study the problem of BAI with fixed confidence under ϵ-global Differential Privacy (DP). First, to quantify the cost of privacy, we derive a lower bound on the sample complexity of any δ-correct BAI algorithm satisfying ϵ-global DP. Our lower bound suggests the existence of two privacy regimes depending on the privacy budget ϵ. In the high-privacy regime (small ϵ), the hardness depends on a coupled effect of privacy and a novel informationtheoretic quantity, called the Total Variation Characteristic Time. In the low-privacy regime (large ϵ), the sample complexity lower bound reduces to the classical nonprivate lower bound. Second, we propose AdaP-TT, an ϵ-global DP variant of the Top Two algorithm. AdaP-TT runs in arm-dependent adaptive episodes and adds Laplace noise to ensure a good privacy-utility trade-off. We derive an asymptotic upper bound on the sample complexity of AdaP-TT that matches with the lower bound up to multiplicative constants in the high-privacy regime. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis of AdaP-TT that validates our theoretical results.","tags":["Differential privacy","Multi-armed bandits","Best-arm identification","Fixed confidence","Top Two algorithm"],"title":"On the Complexity of Differentially Private Best-Arm Identification with Fixed Confidence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Rémy Degenne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1695081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701896400,"objectID":"f7125378a7d64e07c36b9fd0d303735e","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/ttucb/","publishdate":"2023-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ttucb/","section":"publication","summary":"A Top Two sampling rule for bandit identification is a method which selects the next arm to sample from among two candidate arms, a leader and a challenger.

While best-arm identification for linear bandits has been extensively studied in recent years, few works have been dedicated to identifying one arm that is ε-close to the best one (and not exactly the best one). In this problem with several correct answers, an identification algorithm should focus on one candidate among those answers and verify that it is correct. We demonstrate that picking the answer with highest mean does not allow an algorithm to reach asymptotic optimality in terms of expected sample complexity. Instead, a *furthest answer* should be identified. Using that insight to choose the candidate answer carefully, we develop a simple procedure to adapt best-arm identification algorithms to tackle ε-best-answer identification in transductive linear stochastic bandits. Finally, we propose an asymptotically optimal algorithm for this setting, which is shown to achieve competitive empirical performance against existing modified best-arm identification algorithms.","tags":["Linear bandits","Transductive bandits","Epsilon best-answer identification","Gaussian","Game algorithm","Fixed confidence"],"title":"Choosing Answers in ε-Best-Answer Identification for Linear Bandits","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640596262,"objectID":"64518e4b0412473dafe58c30a2820011","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/teaching/univlille_sc_ss22/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/univlille_sc_ss22/","section":"teaching","summary":"Instructor: Céline Duval and Amir Aboubacar","tags":[],"title":"Statistique computationnelle","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Marc Jourdan","Karolis Martinkus","David Roschewitz","Martin Strohmeier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664999454,"objectID":"2828612c308f2bdec2378ab6acea3059","permalink":"https://marcjourdan.netlify.app/publication/pfdcsa/","publishdate":"2021-12-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfdcsa/","section":"publication","summary":"As data of aircraft movements have become freely accessible on a large scale through means of crowdsourcing, their open source intelligence (OSINT) value has been illustrated in many different domains.
